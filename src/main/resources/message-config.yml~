# Welcome to the gConomy messages config!
#
# This file is for configuring messages (duh!).
#
# Colors and other formatting are denoted by an ampersand '&' which is 
# followed by a character. Supported characters are 0 - 9, a - f, and k - o.
#
# Double check that every message has a "quote at the beginning and end",
# and nowhere in between (unless preceded by a back slash '\')!
#
# Words in percent signs and all caps %LIKETHIS% are variables! They will 
# be replaced with the appropriate Player name, Material name, or number.
